# simple-Student-management-system
first step is gurdian ID
guardian ID name: Joy
password: 1234

2nd step is all about student result, You have to enter your child name who is a student
and see her/his score in exam.

available students in my code are Harry, Berry, Akriti and Harsh
to know about harry's result after login gurdian's ID just type Harry to 
see his score.

N:B - It's just a demo, You can make this code longer and newer and it also can use in
any Schools and colleges

Thanks,
Happy coding
